It may seem to be much easier to use the standard import and export directories also for automated processes, e.g.:
 * impex/src/catalog
 * impex/src/customer
But this is not a good idea as you will get in conflict with back office imports/exports and files uploaded in back office.
You should use sub-directories, e.g.:
 * impex/src/catalog/pim
 * impex/src/customer/erp
Then you have two options:
 a) Import files directly from the sub-directories (see project Technolit)
 b) Copy files to standard directory as first step of import process (see project BMW)
