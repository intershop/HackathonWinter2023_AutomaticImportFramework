<description>Returns the process currently executed by this thread.
If there is no such process then the error connector is used.
The implementation is a little strange as we cannot directly access the currently running processes of the current thread. That&apos;s why we start and immediately stop a transient dummy process. In between we can access the parent process of this &quot;running&quot; dummy - and this parent is the actual current process on top of the process stack.
Since the transient dummy process is not full featured, error log entries with &quot;UnsupportedOperationException&quot; may occur. Anyway, the pipelet will ignore it and will continue execution. Nevertheless, there may be subsequent errors that interrupt execution.</description>
