How to report a pipeline result to a job?
How to report a job result to a process chain?

It is not possible to change the result of a job. The Job result is always: State: finished
Only in case of an error end node or of an exception the Job result is failed.

A pipeline can set a return status for a process chain.
It is possible to tell the process chain processor, which "exit-code" should be used.
You can set pipeline dictionary key "ProcessChainResult" and one of the following status:
 * SUCCESS (default)
 * WARNING
 * FAILURE (exit with no endNode)
 * ERROR (also on exception)
 * NOTFOUND
 * INTERRUPTED
In case such a pipeline is used as job pipeline and the job runs within a process chain,
then the job is always "State: finished" and "green",
but the surrounding process chain task "Type: ProcessChainJob" gets the result from the pipeline dictionary of the job pipeline,
and can have TaskStatus ERROR and be "red".
